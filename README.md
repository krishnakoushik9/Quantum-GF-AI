# QuantumGirlfriend v1.0: DramaFusion AI

Welcome to the QuantumGirlfriend v1.0 project repository! This innovative AI project aims to create a unique conversational experience by fine-tuning a large language model with the personality traits of a "possessive girlfriend" inspired by C-dramas and K-dramas.

## 🚀 Project Overview

QuantumGirlfriend v1.0 is an experimental AI project that explores the intersection of large language models and personality emulation. By fine-tuning the Llama 3.1 8-billion-parameter model with carefully curated data from popular Asian dramas, we aim to create an AI companion with a distinct and engaging persona.

### Key Features

- 🤖 Fine-tuned Llama 3.1 8B model
- 💻 Training dataset derived from C-drama and K-drama subtitles
- ⚡ Utilizes LoRa and Unsloth for efficient fine-tuning on Google Colab
- 💾 Generates a quantized GGUF file for high-performance interaction
- 🎭 Emulates the personality of a "possessive girlfriend" character

## 🛠️ Project Structure

- `index.html`: The main webpage for the QuantumGirlfriend v1.0 project.
- `ambient.mp3`: Background ambient sound for the webpage.

## 🌐 Web Interface

The project currently features a web interface with the following elements:

- Glitch effect on the title "QuantumGirlfriend v1.0"
- Information about the project's key features
- Ambient sound playback functionality

To view the web interface:
1. Clone this repository
2. Open `index.html` in a web browser

## 🧠 Model Training (Planned)

The QuantumGirlfriend v1.0 model training process is planned as follows:

1. Data Collection: Subtitles from popular C-dramas and K-dramas will be collected and preprocessed.
2. Fine-tuning: The Llama 3.1 8B model will be fine-tuned using LoRa and Unsloth on Google Colab.
3. Quantization: The resulting model will be quantized to create a GGUF file for efficient deployment.

(This section will be updated with more details as the training process progresses)

## 🚧 Work in Progress

This project is currently in its early stages. The following features are planned for future development:

- Implementation of the AI model training pipeline
- Integration of the trained model with the web interface
- Development of a chat interface for interacting with the AI
- Expansion of the dataset and fine-tuning process
